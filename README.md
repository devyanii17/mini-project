# mini-project
Number plate recognition system to enter flat schemes and complexes.

Aim / Objective :

To detect the number plate of a vehicle at the entrances of offices/flat schemes and identify
whether it belongs to the given flat scheme or not, which would control entry and exit of
residents/employees and visitors.

Problem Statement Description :

Real Time Number Plate Recognition System is an image processing technology to design an efficient
automatic authorized vehicle identification system by using the vehicle number plate. It uses
number (license) plate to identify the vehicle and its owner. It allows smooth entry/exit of desired
members in the premises.

Modules :

1. Firstly, read an image (from Dataset / captured by camera) using OpenCV.
2. Apply filtering, edge detection, use contour search to detect the license plate.
3. Extract license number in the text format using OCR with Easy OCR.
4. Search for the license number in Database.
5. If the license number exists in the database, permit entry.
Else, register that vehicle and permit entry.

Technology Used :

The technology to be used for this project is Python 3.7, OpenCV, Easy OCR for the extraction of
number from the number (license) plate. For the frontend and backend working of our web
application we will use HTML , CSS , PHP and MySQL.

Benefited Multitude :

• Business complexes and residential society administrations will be benefited in many ways
like fast processing of entry/exit and parking management systems .

• If the system is integrated with GPS , it would help in traffic monitoring, local surveillance,
for tracing stolen vehicles in complexes.

Future Scope :

• By connecting the application to actual hardware at entrances of offices/flat schemes that
would control entry and exit of residents/employees and visitors.

• This system can also be used for systematic parking arrangements and supervising parking
toll.
